**Live Demo:** https://incalc.netlify.app/

Note: The deployed demo version is example-only. It doesn't use actual data from any insurance company.

## How It's Made

inCalc is built using ReactJS. This enables it to be fast and responsive to any changes, meaning that you don't have to refresh the page or keep clicking a "Submit" button each time you make a change.


This was my main motive for making the application. Before inCalc, I was using a legacy calculator application that wasn't responsive to inputs (nor mobile friendly). 
So I decided to build my own solution to improve my day-to-day productivity.
